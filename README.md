# Toxic Comment Classification

This project involves building a **Toxic Comment Classification** model using a dataset from Kaggle's **Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge**. The model classifies comments as toxic or non-toxic using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to train a machine learning model capable of classifying toxic comments. The dataset is preprocessed, vectorized, and then passed through a sequential model built with TensorFlow/Keras. The model is then evaluated for performance and used in a Gradio web interface for real-time comment scoring.
